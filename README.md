# üóÇÔ∏è TODO List API

This is a simple RESTful backend API for managing TODO lists and items. Built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**, this project lets users create, update, and delete todo lists and their corresponding items.

## üöÄ About the Project

This is my **first ever backend project**, built as part of my **Practice School (PS)** at BITS Pilani. The aim was to understand how backend systems work, how REST APIs are structured, and how databases (MongoDB in this case) interact with Node.js applications.
